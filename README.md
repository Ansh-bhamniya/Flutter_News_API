# NEWS APP IN FLUTTER WITH API

I’m excited to share my journey in building a feature-rich News App with Flutter, using the power of GetX for state management and seamless API integration.

I’ll be fetching live news updates to keep the app dynamic and engaging. By utilizing Flutter GetX and Provider, I aim to create a smooth and responsive user experience.

I’ll also explore best practices and techniques to design a stunning News App UI, incorporating FlutterHero for enhanced visual appeal.

Whether you're experienced with Flutter or just starting out, I hope you find something valuable in this project. Let’s create the ultimate News App together!
